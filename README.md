### Week 2

Here you'll find the assignment for Week 2. This weeks lectures covered:

- Introduction to keywords and identifiers in C programming.
- Understanding fundamental operations and operators in C, including arithmetic, relational, logical, and bitwise operators.
- Exploring expressions and their role in C programming.
- Understanding the `sizeof` operator and its role in determining the size of data types.
- Exploring the `int` data type and its usage in C programming.
- Introduction to the `float` data type and its usage for representing floating-point numbers.

### Week 3

Here you'll find the assignment for Week 3. This weeks lectures covered:

- Practice with input/output operations, reinforcing concepts from Week 2.
- Further exploration of keywords, identifiers, expressions, and the `sizeof` operator.
- Introduction to the switch statement and its usage for multi-way branching in C programming.
- Understanding the comma operator and its role in sequence expressions.

### Week 4

Here you'll find the assignment for Week 4. This weeks lectures covered:

- Introduction to functions, including their definition and usage in C programming.
- Understanding function prototypes and their importance in declaring functions before their use.
- Exploring the concept of recursion and its application in solving problems.
- Understanding scope rules in C programming, including local, global, and block scope.
- Differentiating between call by value and call by reference in function parameter passing.

### Week 5

Here you'll find the assignment for Week 5. This weeks lectures covered:

- Exploration of pointers, covering their syntax, usage, and memory management.
- Understanding the concept of arrays, including their declaration, initialization, and manipulation.
- Comprehensive coverage of call by reference, examining its implementation and advantages over call by value.

## Structured Programming

Welcome to the Structured Programming section, the second part of the course where we delve deeper into the C language.

### Week 1: Introduction to Enums, Preprocessor, and Assert Statement

Here you'll find the materials and assignments for Week 1, covering:

- Introduction to enums (enumerated types) in C programming.
- Understanding preprocessor directives, including #define, #include, and #ifdef.
- Exploring the assert() statement for debugging and error handling.

### Week 2: Structs and Stack Implementation

In Week 2, we explored the concept of structs and their implementation in C programming. Structs allow us to create custom data types by grouping together related variables, providing a convenient way to organize and manipulate data.

We also delved into the fundamental concept of stacks and how to implement them using structs. Stacks are abstract data types that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, making them suitable for various applications such as expression evaluation, function call management, and more.

#### Structs in C:

- Introduction to structs and their syntax in C programming.
- Understanding how structs allow us to define custom data types.
- Exploring practical examples of struct usage, including defining employee records, cards in a deck, and more.

#### Stack Implementation:

- Understanding the stack data structure and its operations: push, pop, and isEmpty.
- Hands-on practice with implementing a stack using structs in C.
- Real-world applications of stacks and their significance in computer science.

### Week 3: Linked Lists and Binary Search Trees

In Week 3, we explored linked lists and their manipulation, along with an introduction to binary search trees (BSTs) and their properties. Here's what we covered:

#### Linked Lists:

- Introduction to singly linked lists and their implementation in C.
- Working with linked list nodes and pointers.
- Creating, traversing, and printing linked lists.
- Operations on linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, and searching.

#### Understanding Binary Search Trees (BSTs):

- Understanding binary search trees (BSTs) and their properties.
- Implementing BSTs in C and performing common operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Week 4: File I/O and Command Line Arguments

In Week 4, we focused on two important topics: File I/O and working with command line arguments (`argc` and `argv`). Here's what we covered:

#### File I/O:

- Introduction to File I/O operations in C programming.
- Reading data from files using `fopen()`, `fscanf()`, and `fclose()` functions.
- Writing data to files using `fprintf()` and `fwrite()` functions.
- Handling file errors and checking for file existence.

#### Command Line Arguments:

- Understanding the `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument vector) parameters in the `main()` function.
- Parsing command line arguments and using them to control program behavior.
- Practical examples of command line argument usage in C programs.

#### Rational Numbers:

- Implementation of basic arithmetic operations on rational numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Reading rational numbers from a file and performing arithmetic operations.
- Creating and traversing a binary tree structure from integer pairs read from a file.

## C++ for C Programmers A + B

In this section, I'll summarize the third and fourth parts of the course, which focus on transitioning from C to C++, leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, and exploring the advancements and improvements offered by C++ over C. Let's dive into the details:

### Week 1: Introduction to C++

In Week 1, we delved into the following key topics:

- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
- Conversion of C code to C++.
- Highlighting the significant differences and improvements of C++ over C.

### Week 2

In Week 2, we explored the following topics:

- Introduction to classes in C++ including constructors and destructors.
- Understanding the concept of operator overloading and its implementation in C++.
- Exploring the concept of generic functions and their usage in C++ programming.
- Learning about enums in C++ and how they provide a way to define a set of named integral constants representing enumerators.
- An introductory session on graph theory, its significance, and basic concepts.
