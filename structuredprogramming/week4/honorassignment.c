/* Honor assignment of week 4

Task:
    - Open and read a file of integer pairs into an array that is created with the first integer telling you how many to read.

    - Write a routine that places these values into a binary tree structure. Then walk the tree “inorder” and print these values to the screen.


Example:
    - So  4 9  11  4  5    would mean create an integer array size 4 and read into data[].
